I am a first-year PhD student at Tufts University, advised by Professor Saeed Mehraban and Professor Vladimir Podolskii. My research is in computational complexity theory with a focus on quantum complexity. Lately I have been thinking about weak (near-term) models of quantum computation, specifically low-depth circuits and noisy circuits. I am also interested in Hamiltonian complexity. I previously received a BS in Mathematics and Computer Science and an MS in Computer Science from Tufts University.
