I am a first-year PhD student at Tufts University, advised by Professor Saeed Mehraban and Professor Vladimir Podolskii. My research is in quantum information with a focus on quantum complexity theory. I am currently studying sub-universal quantum models and classical simulation of quantum models to better understand the ways in which quantum resources provide a computational advantage. I am also interested in classical complexity theory. I previously received a BS in Mathematics and Computer Science and an MS in Computer Science from Tufts University.
